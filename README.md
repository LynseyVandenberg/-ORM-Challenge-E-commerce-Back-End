# Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) Challenge: E-commerce Back End

## Description
This is a backend database for a mock ecommerce site that utilizes [MySQL]("https://dev.mysql.com/doc/"), [Express]("https://expressjs.com/"), and [Sequelize]("https://sequelize.org/").

Because this application is not deployed, I have created a walk through demo of the database functionality using [Insomnia]("https://support.insomnia.rest/"). 

## Acceptance Criteria
* GIVEN a functional Express.js API
* WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
* THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
* WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
* THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
* WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
* THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
* WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
* THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
* WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
* THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
